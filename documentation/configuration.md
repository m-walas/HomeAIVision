# Configuration Guide

Once HomeAIVision is installed, you can configure it to suit your needs. This guide walks you through the available settings and how to customize them.

## Installation and Initial Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before installing HomeAIVision, ensure you have the following:

- **Home Assistant Installation**: Running locally, on a device like a Raspberry Pi, or a VM. More details can be found here.
- **Camera Setup**: Accessible via a URL, testable in a web browser. Ensure your camera stream is accessible from the network Home Assistant is on.
- **Azure Account**: Active account with an API key and endpoint URL from Azure Cognitive Services. Get your API key here.

### Step-by-Step Installation and Configuration

1. **Download the Integration**:
   - Visit the GitHub repository.
   - Click on the 'Code' button and select 'Download ZIP'. Extract the file.

2. **Install the Custom Component**:
   - Ensure a `custom_components` directory exists in your Home Assistant configuration directory (`/config`).
   - Copy the `homeaivision` folder from the extracted ZIP into the `custom_components` directory.

3. **Restart Home Assistant**:
   - This step is necessary to recognize the new integration. Restart via the server management page or restart the Home Assistant service.

4. **Add the Integration**:
   - Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in Home Assistant.
   - Click on **Add Integration** and search for **HomeAIVision**.
   - Fill in your Azure API key, endpoint URL, and integration title as prompted. These can be obtained from your Azure Cognitive Services account.

## Initial Configuration

After adding the integration, you will need to configure the global settings and add your camera devices. The configuration is divided into two main sections:

- **Global Settings**: Azure credentials and integration-wide preferences.
- **Device Settings**: Individual camera configurations and detection parameters.

### Configuration Flow Overview

HomeAIVision uses a configuration flow to guide you through setting up the integration and adding camera devices. The process consists of the following steps:

**User Step**:

- **Integration Title**: Assign a friendly name to your HomeAIVision integration.

**Azure Configuration Step**:

- **Azure API Key**: Enter your Azure Cognitive Services API key.
- **Azure Endpoint**: Enter the endpoint URL for your Azure Cognitive Services.
- **Language**: Select the language for notifications and interface elements.

**Options Flow**:

- **Action Selection**: Choose to add, edit, or remove a camera device.

1. **Add Camera**:
   - **Camera Settings**: Configure basic settings such as name and camera URL.
   - **Detection Settings**: Configure object detection parameters and motion detection settings.

2. **Edit Camera**:
   - **Camera Settings**: Update camera name and URL.
   - **Detection Settings**: Update detection parameters and motion detection settings.

3. **Remove Camera**: Select and remove an existing camera device.

*Note*: Refer to the [Technical Documentation](technical_documentation.md) for a detailed explanation of each configuration step and the underlying processes.

### Advanced Settings

For advanced configurations, such as customizing motion detection parameters and object detection thresholds beyond the initial setup, refer to the [Technical Documentation](technical_documentation.md).

## Changing Configuration

To update settings after the initial setup:

- Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in Home Assistant.
- Find **HomeAIVision** and click on **Options**.
- Choose an action:
  - **Add Device**: Add a new camera device.
  - **Edit Device**: Modify settings of an existing camera.
  - **Remove Device**: Remove an existing camera from the integration.

Follow the prompts to adjust settings as needed and save changes.

## Adding a New Camera Device

- Go to **Configuration > Integrations > HomeAIVision > Options**.
- Select **Add Device**.
- Enter the camera's name and URL.
- Configure detection settings, including objects to detect, confidence thresholds, and motion detection parameters.
- Save the configuration to add the new camera to HomeAIVision.

## Editing an Existing Camera Device

- Go to **Configuration > Integrations > HomeAIVision > Options**.
- Select **Edit Device**.
- Choose the camera you want to modify.
- Update the desired settings and save changes.

## Removing a Camera Device

- Go to **Configuration > Integrations > HomeAIVision > Options**.
- Select **Remove Device**.
- Choose the camera you want to remove.
- Confirm the removal to delete the camera from HomeAIVision.

### Best Practices

- **Secure Your Azure Credentials**: Keep your Azure API key and endpoint URL confidential. Do not expose them in public repositories or unsecured locations.
- **Optimize Motion Detection Parameters**: Adjust `motion_detection_min_area` and `motion_detection_history_size` to reduce false positives and enhance detection accuracy based on your environment.
- **Regularly Review Saved Images**: Monitor and manage saved images to ensure you are only storing relevant data and not exceeding storage limits.
- **Update Integration Regularly**: Keep HomeAIVision updated to benefit from the latest features, improvements, and security patches.

For more detailed technical information and troubleshooting, refer to the respective sections in the **[Full Documentation](README.md)**.
