## Overview

HomeAIVision leverages Azure Cognitive Services to provide intelligent object detection and motion analysis from your camera feeds. Whether you're looking to enhance home security or monitor activity, HomeAIVision offers a reliable and customizable solution.

For detailed information on installation, configuration, and technical aspects, please refer to the [Full Documentation](docs/README.md).

## Installation and Configuration

Before installing HomeAIVision, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Home Assistant Installation**: Running locally, on a device like a Raspberry Pi, or a VM. More details can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/).
- **Camera Setup**: Accessible via a URL, testable in a web browser. Ensure your camera stream is accessible from the network Home Assistant is on.
- **Azure Account**: Active account with an API key and endpoint URL from Azure Cognitive Services. [Get your API key here](https://portal.azure.com/).

### Step-by-Step Installation and Configuration

1. **Download the Integration**:
   - Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/m-walas/HomeAIVision).
   - Click on the 'Code' button and select 'Download ZIP'. Extract the file.

2. **Install the Custom Component**:
   - Ensure a `custom_components` directory exists in your Home Assistant configuration directory (`/config`).
   - Copy the `homeaivision` folder from the extracted ZIP into the `custom_components` directory.

3. **Restart Home Assistant**:
   - This step is necessary to recognize the new integration. Restart via the server management page or restart the Home Assistant service.

4. **Add the Integration**:
   - Navigate to **Configuration** > **Integrations** in Home Assistant.
   - Click on **Add Integration** and search for **HomeAIVision**.
   - Fill in your Azure API key, endpoint URL, and camera URL as prompted. These can be obtained from your Azure Cognitive Services account.

5. **Configure Detection Settings**:
   - After adding the integration, go to **Configuration** > **Integrations** > **HomeAIVision** > **Options**.
   - Configure detection settings such as objects to detect, confidence thresholds, motion detection parameters, notification preferences, and image saving options.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Utilizes Azure Cognitive Services to identify objects such as persons, cars, cats, and dogs in the camera feed.
- **Notifications**: Alerts are sent to your devices upon detection of specified objects, ensuring you're always informed about relevant events.
- **Image Saving**: Captures and saves images where specified objects are detected, organizing them based on your settings for easy access and review.
- **Motion Detection**: Detects motion in the camera feed using pixel difference analysis to trigger object detection only when necessary, optimizing performance and reducing unnecessary API calls.
